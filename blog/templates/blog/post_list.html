            ~Don't waste your time on work that you  don't enjoy. It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something you don't like. Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.

            ~It's stupid to be afraid of other's opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If  you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you're a legend.

            ~Take control of your life. Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don't procrastinate. Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
            ~Appreciate the people around you. Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn't take them for granted.

            "I understand there's a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons and old movies. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid, and outwit, that guy."
